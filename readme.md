Instantly expose your WooCommerce storefront to AI agents via ACP, UCP, and MCP protocols.

## Description

AI Shopping for WooCommerce lets any AI agent — ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot, or a custom agent — discover products, build carts, negotiate checkout, and track orders on your WooCommerce store without ever rendering a browser page.

**Zero configuration required.** Activate the plugin, generate an API key, and your store is AI-ready.

AI Shopping for WooCommerce requires the most current version of WooCommerce. You can find that [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/).

### Three Protocols, One Plugin

* **Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)** — The OpenAI / Stripe standard for AI-powered checkout (spec 2026-01-30). Supports capability negotiation, extensions, discounts, payment handlers, and amounts in minor units.
* **Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)** — The Shopify / Google standard with `/.well-known/ucp` discovery and capability negotiation (spec 2026-01-11). Supports structured capabilities, cancel endpoint, and UCP message format.
* **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — The Anthropic standard for tool-based AI interaction (spec 2025-11-25). Includes `title`, `outputSchema`, and proper empty-params handling.

### Features:

* Full product catalog API with search, filtering by category, price range, attributes, stock status, sale status, and more.
* Headless cart management with token-based sessions — no browser cookies required.
* Complete checkout flow: set addresses, choose shipping, select payment method, place order.
* Order tracking and customer account endpoints.
* Webhook notifications for order status changes with HMAC-signed payloads.
* Rate limiting with standard HTTP headers and Bearer token authentication.
* Auto-detection and integration for 16+ popular WooCommerce extensions.
* Admin settings page with API key management, protocol toggles, and a full endpoint reference.
